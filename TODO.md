# TODO

- Smart answer grouping, or hard-code Yes/No or something
- When answering No, maybe ask why? Provide list of possible facts to check?

- Add a way to enter a common name
- Adding a new question should be optional in most cases (check for duplicate species)
- Bug facts should include facts already known

- Filter out weird images, ogg files, etc
- Show bug facts on found page
- Save answers when found existing bug
- Gracefully handle running out of candidate species, asking new questions
- Update species question info when found, using missed questions from above
- Handle case of not found, adding new species including entering questions to differentiate
- Better handling for case of trying to enter a new species, it's already in the db and answers vary form what we've stored

- Add login, user/IP tracking
- Add admin page for editing?
