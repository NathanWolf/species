# TODO

- Filter out weird images, ogg files, etc
- Autocomplete questions at end, don't always use them all
- Gracefully handle running out of candidate species, asking new questions
- Update species question info when found, using missed questions from above
- Handle case of not found, adding new species including entering questions to differentiate
- Better handling for case of trying to enter a new species, it's already in the db and answers vary form what we've stored
