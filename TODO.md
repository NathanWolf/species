# TODO

- Allow for multiple pictures per species?
- Require picking an image
- When answering No, maybe ask why? Provide list of possible facts to check?

- Add a way to enter a common name, aliases (multiple common names per species)

- Better handling of entering questions to differentiate
- Better handling for case of trying to enter a new species 
  if it's already in the db and answers vary form what we've stored.
  (Right now I think this will fail with a constraint violation?)

- Add login, user/IP tracking
- Add admin page for editing?
