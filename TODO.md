# TODO

- Fetch description and maybe sidebar from wikipedia
- Dynamically request data, allow "start over"
- Gracefully handle running out of candidate species, asking new questions
- Update species question info when found, using missed questions from above
- Handle case of not found, adding new species including entering questions to differentiate
- Handle case of trying to enter a new species, it's already in the db and answers vary form what we've stored
